## 4. Engineering Analysis

### Isolation Mechanisms

The runtime uses Linux namespaces such as PID, UTS, and mount namespaces to isolate containers. Each container has its own process space and filesystem view using `chroot`. However, all containers share the same underlying host kernel.

---

### Supervisor and Process Lifecycle

A long-running supervisor process manages all containers. It creates containers using `clone()`, tracks metadata such as PID and state, and handles `SIGCHLD` signals to properly reap child processes and avoid zombies.

---

### IPC, Threads, and Synchronization

Two IPC mechanisms are used:

* FIFO/socket for CLI → supervisor communication
* Pipes for container → supervisor logging

A bounded buffer is used between producer and consumer threads. Mutex locks and condition variables ensure synchronization, preventing race conditions, data loss, and deadlocks.

---

### Memory Management and Enforcement

RSS (Resident Set Size) represents the actual physical memory used by a process. A soft limit generates warnings, while a hard limit enforces termination. This enforcement is implemented in kernel space to ensure reliability and prevent bypassing.

---

### Scheduling Behavior

Experiments show that processes with lower nice values receive more CPU time. CPU-bound processes with higher priority complete faster, while I/O-bound processes demonstrate better responsiveness due to scheduler design.

---

## 5. Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

* Used FIFO/socket IPC instead of shared memory for simplicity and reliability
* Used `chroot` instead of `pivot_root` for easier implementation
* Used mutex-based synchronization since operations may block
* Used threads for logging to avoid blocking the supervisor

Tradeoff: Simpler design reduces complexity but may not be as secure or optimized as production container runtimes.

---

## 6. Scheduler Experiment Results

Two CPU-bound containers were run with different nice values:

* `alpha` → nice = 10 (low priority)
* `beta` → nice = -5 (high priority)

Observation:

* The higher priority container completed faster
* It received more CPU time from the scheduler

Conclusion:
Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) allocates CPU time based on process priority, ensuring fairness while favoring higher-priority processes.
